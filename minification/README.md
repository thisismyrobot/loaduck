According to licence.json from the CodePlex archive, this work is licensed

I have copied that licence in as LICENCE.txt.

## Licence conditions for re-use.

Under the conditions of the licence I think I need to:

 * Include licence - see above.
 * Include copyright - I cannot find any reference to copyright in the  
   CodePlex archive.
 * State changes - none made to the minJS.psm1.
 * Disclose source - see above.
 * Include notice - I think this means the MPL in the source, which it's not  
   in the original so I am not adding it here.
